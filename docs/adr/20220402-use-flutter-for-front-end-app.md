# Use Flutter for front-end app

- Status: accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

Which technology or ecosystem to use for the front-end app?

## Decision Drivers 

- which tools do we have to work with the code
- which devices do we have to run it
- what technology is promising for the future projects

## Considered Options

- iOS native
- Android native
- Flutter
- Hybrid

## Decision Outcome

We choose to use Flutter, because it allows us to run on both mobile platforms, iOS and Android. Some developers have the former, while others have the latter devices. Also, it allows to do development both on MacOS and Linux computers.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Almost simultaneous time-to-market for all target platforms (iOS, Android, Web)
- We will get experience with Flutter

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

- Using native platform features depends on how well they are supported by Flutter
- Look-and-feel may be different from native.
